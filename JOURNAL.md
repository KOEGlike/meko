## 04.29: chose the soc, and usb uart switchin

- choose the esp32-mini-1u because it has support for bluetooth audio and rust
- this chip doesn't have an integrated usb controller, so I had to choose a chip for usb to uart
  
**Total time: 1.5**
  
## 05.05: added the dac/amp chip, added display connector

- there is little info on high quality dac/amp chips, after many days of research and pain a choose the ES9218P, which is a really nice chip to work with, but the datasheet is a bit lackluster
- chose a display, added the flex pcb connector for it
  
**Total time: 2h**
  
## 05.07: added the hall-effect sensor for the wheel

- I saw a wide where a guy made a high precision scrolling device, and he used a hall-effect sensor, I chose to go down this rout because there is no rotory encoder to ware out
  
**Total time: 1h**
  
## 05.08: power, lil bit

- Copy pasted bms and power path chip from previous project, did some calculations, changed resistor values
  
    **Total time:1h**
  
## 05.09: power and usb

- Chose a dual output switching regulator, implemented usb to uart chip
  
    **Total time: 1.5h**
  
## 05.10: audio

- Read the datasheet far more times than i would like to admit
- Some things are not clear
- implemented the things that I kind understand
- asked a question on stackexchange
  
    **Total time: 1.5h**
  
## 05.17: some Chad replied to my question on electronics stackexchange

- Someone who has experience with this rare chip, YIPPPEEEEEE
- I will have to use a oscillator, not a crystal, and low noise LDOs instead of switching regulators
- Did some research on mems vs oscillator vs crystal
  
    **Total time: 2h**
  
## 05.18: implemented to suggestion from stackexchange

- oscillator instead of crystal
- added low noise LDOs
  
    **Total time: 2h**
  
## 05.22: Added components, choose LDOs

- I switched from a esp32-mini-1u to a esp32-pico-mini-02, for an integrated pcb antenna and a smaller from factor
- Chose the micro SD slot, and added it to to the schematic
- the same chad from electronics stackexchange replied to my other question about power delivery for this chip
- Did a lot of datasheet reading abot LDOs and what to choose, and decided that will try to solder 1mm*1mm packages
  
    **Total time: 3h**
  
## 05.23: Power, power, POWER

- implemented the LDOs
- learned a lot about filters, low-pass, high-pass, etc. Interesting topic
- again lots of reaiding
  
    **Total time: 4h**
  
## 05.24: inter chip COM

- the esp32 has a f#$* up io multiplexer if you want to do multiple things
- the SD card pins and the JTAG pins are the same, so if you use an SD card you cant use JTAG, or vice-versa
- all of the pins that can output a i2s clock signal are used by uart or the boot pin
- might need to figure something out for using the same pins for different things
- wired up the hall-effect sensor, en and boot pins with the usb-to-uart adapter, some parts of the dac/amp chip, SD card
- created a symbol for my display
- read a bunch again
  
    **Total time:5h**
  
## 05.25: finishing up the schematic

- finished display, aka copied reference design
- turns out you can you can use gpio0 as a regular gpio0, you just need to make sure that it doesn't get pulled low on boot, so my i2s clock is on gpio0 (aka the BOOT pin)
- chose the headphone jack, and added the footprint and 3d model
- still need to add esd protection in some places
- added buttons
- routed spi for the display, added test points
- i dont have enough gpio to controll the DACs power chips, so they will all start up at once, which is not optimal, but....
- i need to connect up the headphone jack
  
    **Total time: 3h**
  
## 05.25: I'M ALMOST DONE WITH THE SCHEMATIC

- added an I/O expander, because i ran out of I/O
- added led, and haptic motor
- since i added a io expander now i can control the boot sequence of the dac/amp
- added more esd protection
- researched how inline volume controls work
- segmented schmatic
  
    **Total time: 5h**
  
## 05.29: fixed stuff

- removed separate i2c line for the dac, becouse i needed one more gpio for the a ldo enable pin
- changed pull up resistor values on the i2c line
  
    **Total time:0.75h**
  
## 05.30: added fuel gauge, 3d models

- fixed small ERC issues
- realised that i have no way to check the battery percentage
- added a fuel gauge ic
- realised that the ic that i have chosen has the same i2c address as the hall encoder
- chose another ic, this is bga, but only 3x3 so its not that bad
- added all the missing 3d models
- ready for layout
  
    **Total time: 3h**
  
## 05.31: starting layout

- realised that i still need to chose the battery connector, i went with PH2.0
- changed footprint of sk6805
- started the layout, it is kinda hard
  
    **Total time:2h**
  
## 06.01: mockup

- made a mockup
![mockup](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/4d157f3a02e474d4ca8f6a1d4b66b37a692a462f_screenshot_20250601_105028.png)
- arranged the display and the hall sensor based on the mockup
- decided to fold the flex display cable, because i had no space for the hall sensor, luckily my connector has contacts on both sides
- i have to reorder the pins, because of the folding on the flex connector
- reordered the pins
  
    **Total time: 2h**
  
## 06.02: layout is like a puzzle with multiple correct solutions

- arranged the jack and power button based on the mockup
- laid out the dac/amp chip
- added charging led, so you know if you are charging your player
  
    **Total time: 1h**
  
## 06.03: more layout

- arranged the button pull ups and caps
- moved around the dac/amp
- laid out power
- laid out some parts of display
  
    **Total time: 4h**
  
## 06.05: finished with the layout, almost

- realized that the BOOT pin shouldn't be pulled down, but because that way it is booted into firmware mode, so i pulled it up with a 100k resistor, so it doesn't interfere with the i2s that much
- laid out most of the components, some placements are not final, because they will depend on the routing
- moved the via fence around a bit

    **Total time: 2h**
  
## 06.06: routing started

- routed most of the important circuits, like the usb lines and the i2s lines
  
    **Total time: 1h**
  
## 06.07: maybe chose a too small pcb size

- I'm starting to have trouble routing some tracks, I may have made an oopsie 
- routed the short tracks, kind of a grind
- finished the routing, time to send it of to reddit
  
    **Total time:3h**
  
## 06.10: fixed fuel gauge 

- some chad redditor saw that i had connected my fuel gauge IC wrong, i connected SRX to the output of the batter charger, instead of connecting SRX to the batter input of the batter charger
  
    **Total time: 1h**
  
## 06.11: small fixes, moved stuff around

- flipped buttons, cuz it didnt make sense to have them on the other side
- added vias to the bottom pad of the dac, forgot about them 
- other small fixes
- selected some components based on the value in the schematic
  
    **Total time: 3h**
  
## 06.12: picked MPNs, stiching VIAs, 3d modeling

- choose MPNs based on the footprints and values  
- added stiching VIAs
- imported the bearing 3d model that i want to use
- started modeling the e ink display, and real realised that the connector i chose for it is for 1mm thich FPCs, and the cable on the display is 0.3mm 
- i have to choose a new connector
- turns out, 1mm, is the height of the connector and not the cable, so im fine, panic over *hhuuhhh*
  
**Total time: 3h**
  
## 06.13: CAAAD, fixes

- chose a 6701 bearing
- moved buttons and mounting holes around to make space for it
- moved jack out to board edge, because it had interfered with the pcb 
  
**Total time:3h**
  
## 06.14: CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD

- done with the bottom part of the case, mostly
- the top part is also almost done
- moved stuff around on the pcb to make the device more thin
- player is still 16 mm thich 
- choose battery 
  
**Total time: 4h**
  

## 06.17: Almost finished with the case

- I was wrong about the to part almost being done
- added holes to the top case for the threaded inserts that i will glue in 
- added a rim to the top case so when i tighten the screws this rim will be the main contact point with the pcb 
- added a stopper to the bearing hole, so that it will sit at known hight, and not at some random hight in the hole, also prevents the bearing from touching some components 
- figured out how to keep the display in place, will model it later
- adding some images, I havent done this in a while, i might have to back journal, and add some more, cuz this journal is basically a wall of text

**Total time: 3h**
  

## 06.18: finished cad

- Finished display retainer, it's like a plate that is held down by the pcb  
![display retainer](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/08957b6ea1ca3302bf148e194c0685681e29c92b_screenshot_20250618_192323.png)
- modeled the button 
- I found a way to make it thinner, firstly buy leaving the battery less wiggle room, and a cutout for the battery in the case, this will reduce the thickness by like 2mm, so it will be around 13,5mm 
- choose the magnet for that hall-effect rotation encoder, here is [the link](https://www.first4magnets.com/product/6mm-dia-x-1mm-thick-diametrically-magnetised-n42-neodymium-magnet-20413)
  
**Total time: 4h**
  
## 06.19: rounded tracks, cad assembly 

- created a cad assembly
![cad assembly](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/a5b988545cf45da093c869a047a75b005e332548_screenshot_20250619_204859.png)
- modeled the buttons
- made the wheels dimensions parametric
- i created a new branch for V1 of the PCB, so I can have rounded tracks, which are annoying to edit
- the next thing to do is to create some renders in blender 
- in blender the transparent material i want to use for the 3d printed plastic parts, is not transparent, so i spent 1,5h on this, and still couldnt figure it out, AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
![not transparent glass shader](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/d4d4ac2bdab54ed7fd1395fb5da7fc241c5fd0b4_screenshot_20250620_145026.png)

  
**Total time: 4h**

## 06.20: I'm in a love hate relationship with blender

- turns out you need to enable raytracing for transparent things, otherwise it will be a mirror
- all the things i looked up had the old blender ui, so I asked on reddit, and a chad responed overnight, so now i know where to enable raytracing 
- mucked around with the kicad exporter and blender importer for the pcb 
- i thought that i needed to merge all the geometries to move them at once, but after the merge you cant easily change the materials of the combined mesh, and i accidentally set the bearing material to glass, so i had to redo the whole thing again, because you cant unmerge a merged mesh, and i was out of undo states, so i had to redo the whole thing, but I was now way
faster
- made an animation of the player, that is rendering right now 
![transparent glass shader](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/fd212f771b0da2ebeefdf873f040a7749927dd7e_0001.png)  
- blender wasn't using my gpu, so I had to update some drives an tweek some setting in nixos
  
**Total time: 3,5h**
  

## 06.21: FINISHED 

- finished the render that i started yesterday
- made an exploded animation blender 
- made a BOM 
- made a readme 
- converted renders to webp 
- made production files, and a github release 
- small polishing changes 
  
**Total time: 4h**
